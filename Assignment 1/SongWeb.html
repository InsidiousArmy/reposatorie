            <h3>  [Verse 1]
                I've been waiting around
                For someone like her to get in contact with me
                She could be the greatest
                I know she'd be the greatest
                If only she was open to see me
                It's alright, though
                'Cause I got time
                Time isn't my essence and time isn't the line
                It's alright, though
                She'll give me a buzz
                I'll call her my baby
                And she'll call me her cuz
                Well, I think I'm in love 'cause  </h3>

                <h3>  [Chorus]
                    Lately, I call you
                    When I do nothing, oh
                    Lately, I call you
                    When I do nothing, oh (x2) </h3>

                    <h3>  [Verse 2]
                        Well, that is love
                        Yeah, that is love and it's hard to do
                        It's a job for two  </h3>

                        <h3>  [Bridge]
                            How do I do what I do
                            If I don't get nothing from you?
                            And I've so much work to do
                            Yeah, I've so much work to do now
                            Oh, it's work for you 'cause  </h3>

                            <h3>  [Chorus]
                                Lately, I call you
                                When I do nothing, oh
                                Lately, I call you
                                When I do nothing, oh (x2) </h3>
